# Aim

To understand and implement client-side routing in a React application using React Router DOM, enabling seamless navigation between multiple views without full page reloads.

# Learning Outcomes

After completing this practical, students will be able to:

Explain the concept of client-side routing and differentiate it from traditional server-side routing in web applications.

Configure and use React Router DOM to define routes using components such as BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route.

Implement navigation between components using routing features like Link, NavLink, and dynamic URL parameters.

Develop a multi-page React application structure that improves user experience through faster navigation and modular component design.
